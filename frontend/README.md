```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Collaboration Guidelines

1. Pull origin `git pull origin frontend`

2. Create a new branch for the task you were assigned to, eg `(Feat/Bug/Fix/Chore)/title` : `git checkout -b Feat/Home-page`

3. After making changes, format, lint and test your codes with `npm run format`

4. Then stage your files `git add .`

5. Commit your changes with a descriptive commit message : `git commit -m "your commit message"`.

6. IMPORTANT: To make sure there are no conflicts, run `git pull origin frontend`.

7. Push changes to your new branch, run `git push -u origin Feat/Home-page`.

8. Create a pull request to the `frontend` branch not `main`.

9. Ensure to describe your pull request.
